Let's add some explanation about GitHub:
Git is a revision control system, a tool to manage the source code history 
GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories.
The difference between New repository and New project is that new repository is about Github and Git. In contrast, new project is about Git.
What is repository ? It is the storage space for my project, it allows me to share the files.
What is a branch ? Branches allow me to work on other features.
What is make  commit ? It records changes to one or more fils in my branch in which SHA is included, it identifies specific changes.A
